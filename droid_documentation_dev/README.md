# Factory-Crucible/jboss-eap-quickstarts
- Introduction to the docs

## Overview
This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the `Factory-Crucible/jboss-eap-quickstarts` codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

### Purpose
The `Factory-Crucible/jboss-eap-quickstarts` repository aims to provide a comprehensive example of a Jakarta EE web application project for JBoss EAP. It includes various components and configurations that demonstrate best practices and capabilities within the JBoss ecosystem. This repository fits into the larger picture as a quickstart guide for developers looking to implement similar applications using JBoss EAP.

### Technologies used
The primary technologies used in this repository include:
- **Jakarta EE**: A set of specifications that enables the development of enterprise applications.
- **JBoss EAP**: An open-source platform for building, deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services.
- **Spring Boot**: Utilized in the migration plan for transitioning the application.
- **Helm**: Used for managing Kubernetes deployment configurations.

### Major Components
The codebase consists of several major components:
- **Frontend**: Located in `src/main/webapp`, it includes web pages and static resources.
- **Backend**: Found in `src/main/java`, it contains core components, business logic, and RESTful services.
- **Testing**: Located in `src/test`, it includes integration tests and resources for an isolated test environment.
- **Migration Plan**: Detailed in the `droid_migration` directory, it outlines the steps for transitioning to Spring Boot.

### Conventions
The codebase follows several conventions:
- **File Naming**: Java classes are named using CamelCase, and configuration files use lowercase with hyphens.
- **Directory Structure**: Organized by functionality, with separate directories for controllers, data access, models, services, and utilities.
- **Annotations**: Utilizes Jakarta EE annotations for dependency injection, RESTful services, and entity management.

## Structure
The structure of the codebase is organized to facilitate maintainability and clarity. Below is an overview of the important directories:

## Main Flows
### Overview Of Flows
The main flows in the codebase revolve around member registration and data management. The `MemberController` class in `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/controller` handles user interactions and communicates with the `MemberRegistration` service in `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/service`. Data is accessed and manipulated through the `MemberRepository` class in `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/data`.

### System Connections
The codebase interacts with various internal and external systems:
- **Database**: Configured through `persistence.xml` in `src/main/resources/META-INF` and `test-persistence.xml` in `src/test/resources/META-INF`.
- **RESTful Services**: Implemented in `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/rest`, facilitating client-server communication.
- **Testing Framework**: Utilizes Arquillian for integration tests, configured in `src/test/resources/arquillian.xml`.

## Testing Principles
The testing principles in this codebase focus on ensuring reliability and stability:
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `src/test/java`, these tests validate core features like member registration in a deployed environment.
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Configured using in-memory databases and managed JBoss EAP instances to avoid interference with production data.
- **Arquillian Framework**: Used for deploying and managing test environments, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

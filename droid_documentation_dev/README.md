- Introduction to the docs

## Overview
This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the `Factory-Crucible/jboss-eap-quickstarts` codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid to ensure it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

### Purpose
The `Factory-Crucible/jboss-eap-quickstarts` repository is designed to provide quickstart examples for JBoss EAP (Enterprise Application Platform). These examples demonstrate best practices and capabilities within the JBoss ecosystem, facilitating the development of Jakarta EE web-enabled database applications. This repository fits into the larger ecosystem by offering sample applications that showcase various technologies and practices, aiding developers in building robust enterprise applications.

### Technologies used
The primary technologies and frameworks used in this codebase include:
- **Jakarta EE**: A set of specifications that extend Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services.
- **JBoss EAP**: A subscription-based/open-source Java EE-based application server runtime used for building, deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services.
- **Arquillian**: A testing platform for Jakarta EE that enables developers to write integration tests for their applications.
- **Hibernate**: An object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for the Java programming language, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.

### Major Components
The codebase is organized into several major components:
- **Frontend**: Located in `src/main/webapp`, this component includes web pages and resources for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Found in `src/main/java`, this component contains the core business logic, data access, and RESTful services.
- **Testing**: Located in `src/test`, this component includes integration tests to ensure the application's functionality.

### Conventions
The codebase follows several conventions to maintain consistency and readability:
- **File Naming**: Java classes are named using CamelCase, and directories are named using lowercase letters with hyphens as separators.
- **Directory Structure**: The project is organized into `src/main` for main source code and `src/test` for test code. Within these directories, further subdirectories are used to separate different concerns such as web resources, configuration files, and core components.

## Structure
The structure of the codebase is as follows:

## Main Flows
### Overview Of Flows
The main flows in the codebase revolve around the member registration functionality. This includes data flow from the frontend to the backend, where user input is processed, validated, and persisted in the database. The `MemberController` class in the `controller` package handles user interactions, while the `MemberRegistration` service in the `service` package manages the business logic for member registration. Data access is facilitated by the `MemberRepository` class in the `data` package, and RESTful services are provided by the `MemberResourceRESTService` class in the `rest` package.

### System Connections
The codebase interacts with several internal and external systems:
- **Database**: The application uses JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interactions, configured via `persistence.xml` in the `META-INF` directory.
- **RESTful Services**: The application exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on `Member` entities, facilitating client-server communication.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Arquillian is used for integration testing, ensuring that the application's core features work correctly in a deployed environment.

## Testing Principles
The codebase follows several testing principles to ensure high quality and reliability:
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `src/test/java`, these tests validate the core features of the application in a deployed environment. For example, `MemberRegistrationIT.java` tests the `MemberRegistration` service using the Arquillian framework.
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Configuration files in `src/test/resources` set up an isolated test environment using an in-memory H2 database, avoiding interference with production data.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover various aspects of the application, including data access, business logic, and RESTful services, ensuring thorough validation of the application's functionality.

## droid_migration
The `droid_migration` directory is dedicated to the comprehensive migration plan for transitioning the JBoss 'kitchensink' application to a Spring Boot application using Java 21. This directory is essential for ensuring a smooth and structured migration process, covering all aspects from pre-migration analysis to cloud deployment and optional MongoDB migration.

### Contents
The `droid_migration` directory contains the following file:

- **FAC-123_migration_plan.md**: This file provides a detailed migration plan, including sections on pre-migration analysis, project setup, core application migration, testing, cloud deployment, and an optional MongoDB migration phase. It also outlines risk mitigation strategies and an estimated timeline for the migration process.

### Key Components
- **FAC-123_migration_plan.md**: This document is the cornerstone of the migration process. It is structured to guide the development team through each phase of the migration, ensuring that all critical aspects are addressed. The plan is divided into several key sections:
  
  - **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the migration objectives and scope.
  - **Pre-Migration Analysis**: Details the initial analysis required to understand the current state of the application and identify potential challenges.
  - **Migration Phases**: Breaks down the migration into manageable phases:
    - **Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure**: Covers the initial setup of the Spring Boot project and necessary infrastructure.
    - **Phase 2: Core Application Migration**: Focuses on migrating the core functionalities of the application.
    - **Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the migrated application meets quality standards through rigorous testing.
    - **Phase 4: Cloud Deployment and DevOps**: Details the steps for deploying the application to the cloud and setting up DevOps pipelines.
    - **Phase 5: MongoDB Migration (Optional)**: Provides guidelines for migrating the database to MongoDB, if required.
  - **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Identifies potential risks and outlines strategies to mitigate them.
  - **Conclusion**: Summarizes the migration plan and next steps.

### Usage & Examples
The `FAC-123_migration_plan.md` file is used as a reference guide throughout the migration process. Below are examples of how different sections of the plan are utilized:

- **Pre-Migration Analysis**: Before starting the migration, the development team conducts a thorough analysis of the existing JBoss application. This includes reviewing the current architecture, identifying dependencies, and assessing potential challenges. The findings are documented in this section to inform the subsequent phases.
- **Project Setup and Infrastructure**: The team follows the guidelines in this section to set up the Spring Boot project. This includes configuring the build tools, setting up the development environment, and establishing the necessary infrastructure components.
- **Core Application Migration**: During this phase, the team migrates the core functionalities of the JBoss application to Spring Boot. The plan provides detailed instructions on how to refactor the code, replace JBoss-specific components with Spring Boot equivalents, and ensure compatibility with Java 21.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: The team uses the testing strategies outlined in this section to validate the migrated application. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure that the application functions correctly and meets performance requirements.
- **Cloud Deployment and DevOps**: The plan provides a step-by-step guide for deploying the application to the cloud. This includes setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, configuring cloud resources, and monitoring the deployed application.
- **MongoDB Migration (Optional)**: If the team decides to migrate the database to MongoDB, they follow the guidelines in this section. This includes setting up MongoDB, migrating data from the existing database, and updating the application to use MongoDB.

By following the detailed instructions and guidelines provided in the `FAC-123_migration_plan.md` file, the development team can ensure a successful and efficient migration of the JBoss 'kitchensink' application to Spring Boot using Java 21.

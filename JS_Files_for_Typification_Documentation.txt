JavaScript Files for Typification Documentation

Based on the search results in the src/main/webapp directory, no JavaScript (*.js) files were found. However, the following files were identified:

1. src/main/webapp/index.html
   Description: A simple HTML document that serves as an entry point, immediately redirecting users to 'index.jsf' using a meta refresh tag.

2. src/main/webapp/index.xhtml
   Description: A Jakarta Faces (JSF) Facelets template used for rendering the main web page. It includes a welcome message, a member registration form, and a table displaying registered members. This file uses various JSF tags to define the structure and behavior of the web page.

3. src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
   Description: A configuration file for enabling Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) in the Java EE application. It specifies that the bean discovery mode is set to 'all', meaning all beans in the application will be discovered and managed by the CDI container.

Note: The absence of JavaScript files in the searched directory suggests that the current application might be primarily using server-side technologies (Jakarta EE, JSF) for its functionality. If there are any JavaScript files in other directories or if JavaScript code is embedded within the XHTML files, those would need to be identified and considered for the Typification process.

Next steps for the Typification process:
1. Conduct a more comprehensive search of the entire codebase to identify any JavaScript code that might exist outside the src/main/webapp directory.
2. Review the XHTML files for any inline JavaScript that might need to be extracted and converted to TypeScript.
3. Consider the introduction of TypeScript for any new client-side functionality that may be planned for the application.
4. Evaluate the need for TypeScript in the context of the current server-side focused architecture and determine if a gradual introduction of client-side TypeScript would benefit the application.

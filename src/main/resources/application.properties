# This is an unmanaged datasource configuration. It should be used for proofs of concept
# or testing only. It uses H2, a lightweight, in-memory, example database that
# ships with Spring Boot. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported,
# and should NOT be used in a production environment!

# Datasource configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:kitchensink-quickstart;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=sa

# Enable H2 console (optional, for development purposes)
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console

# JPA configuration
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Show SQL statements in logs (optional, for development purposes)
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# The following JNDI name was used in the original JBoss configuration:
# java:jboss/datasources/KitchensinkQuickstartDS
# Note: Spring Boot typically doesn't use JNDI for datasource lookup.
# This is kept here for reference purposes only.

# Additional Spring Boot specific configurations
